          <h1 class="meaning-title">Understanding the Meaning of the Color Green</h1>
          <p class="meaning-dscr">
             Green is associated with nature since it is the color of chlorophyll, a pigment in plants. Because of this connection, green is used for environmental activism — products and actions that protect the environment are “green,” and people with a talent for growing plants have a “green thumb.”
             In Ancient Egypt, green was a symbol of rebirth and regeneration. Green is sacred in Islam as it is connected to the Prophet Muhammad.
             Green also has some negative connotations. Medieval art and literature depicted the devil in green because it was perceived as a pleasant color that attracted animals. A jealous person is sometimes described as “green with envy.”
